# my-assessment

This repository contains the completed tasks for the Qtx/Chisl technical assesment.
It consists of two distinct tasks, these being:

- [ ] SQL (Task 1)
- [ ] Python (Task 2)

## Tasks:
### Task 1 - SQL
- The `SQL.py` and `Advanced_SQL.py` files, found in the `Task_1` folder, contain all of the SQL related questions in the assessment.  **These are the only Task 1 files that will be considered in the grading of your assessment.**
- Task 1 questions are in the form of python functions that simply return a string of your SQL query. The returned SQL query will be run by duckdb's python client as seen in the `Check_your_SQL.ipynb` notebook.
- To verify that your SQL queries are structured as intended, you can run the question functions or any other SQL queries within the `Check_your_SQL.ipynb` notebook to return a result set in the form of a dataframe.


### Task 2 - Python
- The `Python.py` file, found in the `Task_2` folder, contains the python related questions in the assessment. **This is the only Task 2 file that will be considered in the grading of your assessment.**
- The `.csv` files located in the `Task_2/data` folder contain the datasets required to answer the python questions.
